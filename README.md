# ⚡ What is PaddleSmash?

PaddleSmash is a 2-player, old-school paddle ball game powered by Python’s turtle module.
It’s the ultimate battle between two players to see who has the fastest reflexes and the coolest paddle skills.

But here's the twist:
This isn't just a game — it's a launchpad for creativity!
You can change EVERYTHING. From colors to controls to speed and sounds — it’s all yours to tweak.

Think classic Pong — but with your own rules. Your vibe. Your magic.
